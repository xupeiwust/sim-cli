"""Driver registry for sim — lazy-loaded.

Each driver is identified by a stable name and resolved lazily via importlib.
A broken import in one driver no longer crashes the entire CLI: callers that
walk the registry (`iter_drivers`) get a per-driver error; callers that ask
for a specific driver (`get_driver`) get the original ImportError raised so
they can present it directly.

Plugin discovery
----------------
External drivers register themselves via the ``sim.drivers`` entry-point group:

    [project.entry-points."sim.drivers"]
    myname = "my_pkg.module:MyDriver"

These are discovered at import time, validated, sorted by name, and **appended
after** the built-in registry. This ordering is contract: built-ins always
take precedence in `lint` first-match resolution and `solvers list` output;
externals cannot override a built-in name (collisions are logged and skipped).
External `module:Class` strings are stored as-is and resolved lazily by
`_resolve` — discovery never imports the plugin module.
